### 10 Commandments of HCR2
1. **Don’t cheat or go against FS rules**
2. **Only use gems for weekly public events / cups chests**
3. **Scrap only excess parts, especially for legendaries**
4. **Never use the scrapyard when you are tired or impaired**
5. **Upgrade all legendary parts to level 3**
6. **Upgrade all epic parts to level 6**
7. **Never spend scrap on common/rare parts, unless needed for team event**
8. **Complete every monthly season and weekly public event (cheapest legendary parts)**
9. **Only use gems at the shop to buy a part you don’t have**
10. **Always buy the 50k coin scrap in the shop (if available)**
***
### Team philosophy
1. **We are an active and friendly team.** There are no hard rules, but participating in all team matches and 100+km a week are good signs of activity. We try to keep it clean, be respectful, and support one another. 

2. **Real life takes priority.** If you have a problem preventing you from playing, let the team know. We are extremely understanding.

3. **In-game chat** is the preferred means of communication. In the rare event of not being able to communicate in-game, feel free to use other means (e.g. my contact detail at the bottom).

4. **Relax and have fun!**  Rankings are secondary. (Please don't pressure anyone to perform better. If there is an issue that detracts from the positive environment, steps will be taken to address it.) 

5. **Eat plenty fiber!!** 😀
